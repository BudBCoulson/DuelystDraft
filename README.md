# DuelystDraft
Resources for Duelyst Gauntlet draft simulator.

Duelyst was a digital CCG created by Counterplay Games. It was played on a 9x5 board and featured amazing pixel art.
Sadly, the game has now gone defunct.

This program was my simulator for Gauntlet (Duelyst's draft mode). All the art files have been uploaded natively so you can still use this to reminisce about the good old days.
